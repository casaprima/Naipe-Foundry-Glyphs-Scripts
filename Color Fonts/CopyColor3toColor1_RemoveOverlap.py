Copies content from Color layer 3 and adds it to Color Layer 1, preserving the original content of Color 1, then removes the overlap in Color 1.
"""

##Right now this script only works on hard-coded Color layer indices 3 and 1, it'd be nice to have a GUI at some point where one selects which layer to copy to and from, with toggles for keeping the data in the target layer or not, and another for removing the overlap or not
